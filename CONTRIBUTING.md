## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at [https://github.com/pboling/activesupport-logger][🚎src-main]
. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to
the [code of conduct][🤝conduct].

To submit a patch, please fork the project and create a patch with tests.
Once you're happy with it send a pull request.

## You can help!

Take a look at the `reek` list which is the file called `REEK` and find something to improve.

Simply follow these instructions:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Make some fixes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
7. Create new Pull Request.

## The Reek List

To refresh the `reek` list:

```bash
bundle exec reek > REEK
```

## Appraisal

### Generate a new set of Appraisal gemfiles:

```bash
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Appraisal.root.gemfile appraisal update
```

## Run Tests

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

## Lint It

Run all the default tasks, which includes running the gradually autocorrecting linter, `rubocop-gradual`.

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

Or just run the linter.
```bash
bundle exec rubocop_gradual:autocorrect
```

## Release

### One-time, Per-developer, Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Your public key for signing gems will need to be picked up by the line in the
`gemspec` defining the `spec.cert_chain` (check the relevant ENV variables there),
in order to sign the new release.
See: [RubyGems Security Guide][🔒️rubygems-security-guide]

### To release a new version:

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a tests, coverage, & linting sanity check
2. Update the version number in `version.rb`
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Run `git commit -am "🔖 Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
5. Run `git push` to trigger the final CI pipeline before release, & merge PRs
   - NOTE: Remember to [check the build][🧪build]!
6. Run `export GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME="$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d ' ' -f5)" && echo $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
7. Run `git checkout $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
8. Run `git pull origin $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME` to ensure you will release the latest trunk code
9. Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so `rake build` and `rake release` use same timestamp, and generate same checksums
   - Run `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$EPOCHSECONDS && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
   - If the echo above has no output, then it didn't work.
   - Note that you'll need the `zsh/datetime` module, if running `zsh`.
   - In `bash` you can use `date +%s` instead, i.e. `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s) && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
10. Run `bundle exec rake build`
11. Run `bin/checksums` (more [context][🔒️rubygems-checksums-pr]) to create SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums
    - Checksums will be committed automatically by the script, but not pushed
12. Run `bundle exec rake release` which will create a git tag for the version,
    push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][💎rubygems]
