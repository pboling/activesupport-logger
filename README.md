This is an **unofficial** extraction of Rails' v8 `ActiveSupport::Logger`
backported to work with Rails v5.2+ and Ruby 2.7+.

If the suite of gems this is part of is loaded in any version of Rails >= 5.2,
it will replace the logging tooling completely.

Simplified, the load order is basically:

- Enhanced [activesupport-logger][activesupport-logger] (this gem) which was ripped from Rails v8.0
- Enhanced [activesupport-broadcast_logger][activesupport-broadcast_logger] which was ripped from Rails v8.0, and [this PR][pr-53093]
- Enhanced [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging] which was ripped from Rails v8.0, and [this PR][pr-53105]

Above load order is handled for you in [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging] (not this gem),
so depend on that, not this. ;)

[activesupport-logger]: https://github.com/pboling/activesupport-logger
[activesupport-broadcast_logger]: https://github.com/pboling/activesupport-broadcast_logger
[activesupport-tagged_logging]: https://github.com/pboling/activesupport-tagged_logging
[pr-53105]: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53105
[pr-53093]: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53093

## Installation

NOTE: **Don't do this**.  Instead, use [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging]
(not this gem, but which uses this gem as a dependency).

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add activesupport-logger

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install activesupport-logger

## Usage

NOTE: **Don't do this**.  Instead, use [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging]
(not this gem, but which uses this gem as a dependency, and also configures this gem for you).

```ruby
require "activesupport-logger"
```

### With `activesupport-tagged_logging` or `activesupport-broadcast_logger` gems

This gem is automatically depended on and configured by
[activesupport-broadcast_logger][activesupport-broadcast_logger], which in turn is
automatically depended on and configured by
[activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging]
so you don't need to do anything beyond adding [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging]
to your app's Gemfile, and configuring it.

IMPORTANT: If you are using [activesupport-tagged_logging][activesupport-tagged_logging] or
[activesupport-broadcast_logger][activesupport-broadcast_logger],
**do not require [activesupport-logger][activesupport-logger] in your code.**
Load order matters.

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

- ["Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred"][📌major-versions-not-sacred]

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on these libraries using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("activesupport-logger", "~> 1.0")
```

See [CHANGELOG.md][📌changelog] for list of releases.

## 🤑 One more thing

You made it to the bottom of the page,
so perhaps you'll indulge me for another 20 seconds.
I maintain many dozens of gems, including this one,
because I want Ruby to be a great place for people to solve problems, big and small.
Please consider supporting my efforts via the giant yellow link below,
or one of the others at the head of this README.
